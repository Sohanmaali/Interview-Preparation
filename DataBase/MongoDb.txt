What is MongoDB?
Ans-> MongoDB is an open source, nonrelational database management system (DBMS) that uses flexible documents instead of tables and rows to process and store various forms of data.

What will the countDocuments() method return if the collection is empty or does not exist in the database?
Ans-> If the collection is empty or does not exist in the database, the countDocuments() method will return 0.

Are there any query operators that cannot be used with the countDocuments() method?
Ans-> Yes, the countDocuments() method does not support the $where, $near, and $nearSphere operators as part of the query expressions.

How do you insert in MongoDB?
Ans-> To insert documents in MongoDB, use the insertOne() or insertMany() methods, which are the recommended approaches over the deprecated insert() method.

How do I insert a field in MongoDB?
Ans-> To insert a new field in an existing document, use the updateOne() or updateMany() method with the $set operator.

Can I specify a custom _id value when using insert()?
Ans-> Yes, you can specify a custom _id value when using the insert() method. The value of the _id field must be unique to avoid duplicate key errors.

What happens if I try to insert a document with a duplicate _id using the insertOne() method?
Ans-> If you attempt to insert a document with a duplicate _id,

Can I use the insertOne() method inside a transaction?
Ans-> Yes, the insertOne() method can be used inside multi-document transactions, allowing you to ensure atomicity and consistency across multiple operations.

What is the purpose of the writeConcern parameter in the insertOne() method?
Ans-> The writeConcern parameter allows you to specify the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations. This can be useful for ensuring data durability and consistency based on your application’s requirements.

What does the insertOne() method return?
Ans-> The insertOne() method returns an object that includes a boolean acknowledged indicating if the operation was acknowledged by the server and the insertedId field containing the _id of the inserted document

What happens if I try to insert a document with a duplicate _id using insertMany()?
Ans-> If you try to insert a document with a duplicate _id, MongoDB will throw a BulkWriteError. If the ordered option is set to true, the operation will stop at the document with the error. If ordered is set to false, MongoDB will continue inserting the remaining documents.

Can I use the insertMany() method to create a new collection in MongoDB?
Ans-> Yes, if the specified collection does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection when you use the insertMany() method to insert documents into it.

How can I handle errors during the insertMany() operation?
Ans-> You can handle errors during the insertMany() operation by using a try-catch block in your code. This allows you to examine the error details and take appropriate action based on the type of error.

What is the maximum number of documents I can insert using the insertMany() method?
Ans-> The maximum number of documents you can insert using the insertMany() method is limited by the maximum BSON document size, which is 16MB. This means you can insert as many documents as long as the total size of the documents does not exceed 16MB.

Can I insert documents with a mix of specified and unspecified _id fields using insertMany()?
Ans-> Yes, you can insert documents with a mix of specified and unspecified _id fields using insertMany(). MongoDB will automatically generate _id fields for the documents that do not have one specified

What is the difference between updateOne() and updateMany() in MongoDB?
Ans-> The updateOne() method updates a single document that matches the selection criteria, while updateMany() updates all documents that match the criteria.

Can I use the update() method in MongoDB?
Ans-> The update() method has been deprecated in favor of updateOne() and updateMany(). It’s recommended to use these newer methods for more specific and clear update operations.

What happens if no documents match the selection criteria and upsert is set to true?
Ans-> If no documents match the selection criteria and upsert is set to true, a new document will be created using the selection criteria and the update data provided

What is updateOne in MongoDB?
Ans-> updateOne() is a method in MongoDB used to update a single document that matches a specified filter. It updates the first document found in the collection that matches the filter criteria.


What are the differences between the update and updateOne methods in MongoDB?
Ans-> The update method in MongoDB can update multiple documents that match the filter criteria, whereas updateOne updates only the first document that matches the filter.


What is the difference between insertOne and updateOne in MongoDB?
Ans-> insertOne is used to insert a single document into a collection if it doesn’t already exist, while updateOne updates an existing document that matches the specified filter criteria.

What is the use of find() in MongoDB?
Ans-> The `find()` method retrieves documents from a collection by applying specified query criteria. It allows for complex queries, including filtering, projection, and sorting, to get precise data results.

How to find in a MongoDB database?
Ans-> You can use the find() method with optional arguments to query documents. The basic syntax is db.collection.find(selection_criteria, projection, options), where you can define conditions to refine your search.

What is the output of the find() command in MongoDB?
Ans-> The find() command returns a cursor containing all documents that match the specified query criteria. If no documents match, it returns an empty cursor.

How does the new option in findAndModify affect the returned document?
Ans-> The new option, when set to true, returns the modified document after the update operation has been applied. If set to false, it returns the original document before the update.


What is the purpose of the upsert option in findAndModify?
Ans-> The upsert option, when set to true, allows the findAndModify method to insert a new document if no document matches the query criteria. This is useful for ensuring that a document exists with certain values, even if it didn’t exist before.


Can findAndModify be used in transactions?
Ans-> Yes, the findAndModify method can be used in multi-document transactions in MongoDB. This allows you to perform complex operations that involve multiple documents while ensuring that the changes are applied atomicall

What is the difference between findOne() and find() in MongoDB?
Ans-> findOne() retrieves a single document that matches the query criteria, while find() returns a cursor to all documents that match the query criteria. find() can retrieve multiple documents, whereas findOne() is used for fetching only one document.

How can I exclude specific fields from the result using findOne()?
Ans-> You can exclude specific fields from the result by using the projection parameter. For example, to exclude the _id field, you can use: db.collection.findOne(query, { _id: 0 }).

What happens if no document matches the query criteria in findOne()?
Ans-> If no document matches the query criteria, the findOne() method returns null. This allows you to handle cases where the document does not exist

What does findOneAndDelete() do?
Ans-> findOneAndDelete() removes one document from a collection that meets certain conditions and gives back the deleted document.

What parameters does findOneAndDelete() take?
Ans-> The method takes a selection criteria document as its first parameter and optional parameters such as projection, sort, maxTimeMS, and collation.

Can findOneAndDelete() delete multiple documents?
Ans-> No, findOneAndDelete() in MongoDB is designed to delete a single document that matches the query criteria.

How does findOneAndDelete() differ from deleteOne()?
Ans-> findOneAndDelete() returns the deleted document, while deleteOne() does not. Also, deleteOne() deletes a single document matching the filter, while findOneAndDelete() also considers sort order.

Can findOneAndDelete() be used with Write Concern?
Ans-> Yes, the findOneAndDelete() can be used with Write Concern to determine the level of acknowledgment needed from MongoDB for the delete operation.

What does findOneAndReplace do?
Ans-> The findOneAndReplace method finds a single document in a MongoDB collection that matches the specified filter criteria and replaces it with a new document. By default, it returns the original document before the replacement. However, you can modify this behavior to return the newly replaced document by setting the `returnNewDocument` option to true.

What is the difference between findOneAndReplace and replaceOne?
Ans-> The primary difference between findOneAndReplace and replaceOne is that findOneAndReplace returns the document before or after the replacement operation, depending on the returnNewDocument option. In contrast, replaceOne only returns information about the operation’s success and does not return the replaced document. Additionally, findOneAndReplace is useful when you need to return the replaced document or the original document as part of the operation.

Can the findOneAndReplace method be used in multi-document transactions?
Ans-> Yes, the findOneAndReplace method can be used in multi-document transactions. This allows you to perform the find-and-replace operation within a broader transaction that includes multiple operations, ensuring atomicity and consistency across all affected documents.

Can findOneAndUpdate() update multiple documents?
Ans-> findOneAndUpdate() updates only the first document that matches the selection criteria.

How can I update a document and retrieve the updated version in MongoDB?
Ans-> Set the returnNewDocument option to true in the method call.

What is the purpose of the upsert option in findOneAndUpdate()?
Ans-> The upsert option allows you to insert a new document if no document matches the selection criteria.

Can findOneAndUpdate() update embedded documents?
Ans-> Yes, findOneAndUpdate() can update embedded documents within a document

Can the countDocuments() method use indexes to fulfill the query filter?
Ans-> Yes, the countDocuments() method can use indexes to fulfill the query filter, which can help optimize performance.

What will the countDocuments() method return if the collection is empty or does not exist in the database?
Ans-> If the collection is empty or does not exist in the database, the countDocuments() method will return 0.

Are there any query operators that cannot be used with the countDocuments() method?
Ans-> Yes, the countDocuments() method does not support the $where, $near, and $nearSphere operators as part of the query expressions.

Can deleteOne() delete multiple document
Ans-> No, deleteOne() is designed to delete only one document that matches the specified filter. If you need to delete multiple documents, you should use the deleteMany() method.

What happens if no documents match the filter criteria in deleteOne()?
Ans-> If no documents match the filter criteria, the deleteOne() method will not delete any documents, and the returned document will show deleteCount: 0.

How can I ensure that a specific index is used in the deleteOne() operation?
Ans-> You can specify the index to be used by including the hint parameter in your deleteOne() method. This can be either an index specification document or the index name string.

What is a limit in MongoDB?
Ans-> The limit() method in MongoDB is used to specify the maximum number of documents that should be returned in a query result. This method helps control the size of the result set, improving query performance and reducing client load.

What is the limit of aggregate in MongoDB?
Ans-> In MongoDB, the aggregate method can also include a $limit stage, which specifies the maximum number of documents to pass along the pipeline. This is useful for controlling the number of documents processed and returned by the aggregation pipeline.

Can the limit() method be combined with query conditions?
Ans-> Yes, the limit() method can be combined with query conditions in the find() method. This allows you to retrieve a specific number of documents that match certain criteria, further refining the query results.

Can I use skip() to skip documents based on a condition?
Ans-> Yes, you can use `skip()` with a query to skip documents that meet certain criteria. For example, db.collection.find({field: value}).skip(n) will skip the first n documents that match the query.


What happens if I skip more documents than are present in the result set?
Ans-> If you skip more documents than are present in the result set, MongoDB will simply return an empty result set.

Is there a limit to the number of documents I can skip?
Ans-> There is no hard limit to the number of documents you can skip, but skipping a large number of documents can impact performance. It’s generally recommended to use skip() for pagination or small offsets.

Can I use skip() with other query modifiers like sort() or limit()?
Ans-> Yes, you can combine skip() with other query modifiers. For example, db.collection.find().skip(2).limit(5) will skip the first two documents and then limit the result to five documents
